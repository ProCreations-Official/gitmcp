# GitMCP - GitHub MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides comprehensive GitHub integration for AI assistants like Claude, enabling seamless repository management, code browsing, and collaborative workflows.

## üöÄ Enhanced Open Source Contribution Workflows

GitMCP now includes **game-changing improvements** for open source contributions! These new features solve the common problems that make contributing to GitHub projects cumbersome:

### ‚ú® What's New?

**üéØ GitHub Issues Management (NEW!)**
- Create, update, and close issues with full metadata support
- Add comments and participate in issue discussions
- Manage labels, assignments, and milestones
- Advanced issue search and filtering capabilities

**üîÑ Complete Fork-to-PR Workflows**
- `complete_fork_to_pr_workflow` - One function handles everything: fork ‚Üí branch ‚Üí changes ‚Üí PR
- `fork_and_setup_contribution` - Smart forking with automatic branch creation
- `create_cross_repo_pull_request` - Proper fork-to-upstream PR creation

**ü§ù Advanced PR Collaboration**
- Submit reviews with approval/change requests
- Add comments and request specific reviewers
- Update PR titles, descriptions, and settings
- Enable auto-merge for streamlined workflows

**üõ†Ô∏è Intelligent Error Handling**
- Gracefully handles existing forks (no "fork already exists" errors)
- Smart branch creation (works even if branch exists)
- Better permission error messages for 403 scenarios

### üí° Why This Matters

Before these enhancements, contributing to open source required multiple manual steps and often failed due to permission issues when trying to create branches on repositories you don't own. Now Claude can:

1. **"I want to add dark mode to that Streamlit app"** ‚Üí Claude forks, creates feature branch, makes changes, and submits PR
2. **"Fix the typo in their README"** ‚Üí Complete workflow handled automatically  
3. **"Review this PR and approve it"** ‚Üí Claude can participate in code review process

This makes GitMCP the **most powerful GitHub integration for AI assistants**, enabling true collaborative development workflows!

### üéØ Complete GitHub Project Management

With the addition of comprehensive Issues management, GitMCP now provides **end-to-end GitHub project collaboration**:

- **Code Contributions**: Fork ‚Üí Branch ‚Üí Code ‚Üí PR ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Merge
- **Issue Management**: Create ‚Üí Discuss ‚Üí Label ‚Üí Assign ‚Üí Track ‚Üí Close  
- **Project Coordination**: Labels, milestones, assignments, and search across all project artifacts

Claude can now participate in **every aspect** of GitHub project workflows, from initial issue reporting to final code delivery.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ 
- pip (Python package manager)

### Required Python Packages
```bash
pip install fastmcp PyGithub
```

### Option 1: Direct Download
Download the `gitmcp.py` file from this repository and run it directly:
```bash
python gitmcp.py
```

### Option 2: Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProCreations-Official/gitmcp.git
cd gitmcp
pip install fastmcp PyGithub
python gitmcp.py
```

## Setup

### 1. GitHub Authentication

You'll need a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with appropriate permissions:

1. Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic)
2. Generate a new token with these scopes:
   - `repo` - Full control of private repositories
   - `user` - Read user profile data
   - `delete_repo` - Delete repositories (if needed)

### 2. Configure Your AI Client

#### Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gitmcp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/gitmcp.py"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your_github_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/gitmcp.py` with the actual path to where you downloaded or cloned the file.

#### VS Code (with Copilot)

        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your_github_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor

Create `.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json

## Development

### Building from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProCreations-Official/gitmcp.git
cd gitmcp
pip install fastmcp PyGithub
python gitmcp.py
```

### Testing Your Setup
Test that your MCP server is working by running it directly:
```bash
python gitmcp.py
```

You should see output indicating the FastMCP server has started.

### Using MCP Inspector
Debug your MCP server with the official inspector:
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector python gitmcp.py
```

This will open a web interface where you can test all the available tools interactively.

## Security Considerations

- Store your GitHub token securely using environment variables
- Use tokens with minimal required permissions
- Regularly rotate your access tokens
- Review tool permissions before granting access
- Be cautious with destructive operations like `delete_repo`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Server not found" or "Command not found" error**
   - Verify Python is installed and accessible via `python` command
   - Check the full path to `gitmcp.py` is correct in your config
   - Try using the full path to Python: `/usr/bin/python3` or `/usr/local/bin/python`

2. **"No module named 'fastmcp'" or "No module named 'github'"**
   - Install the required packages: `pip install fastmcp PyGithub`
   - If using Python virtual environments, ensure packages are installed in the active environment

3. **Authentication errors**
   - Check your GitHub token has the required scopes (`repo`, `user`)
   - Verify the token is set correctly in the environment variables
   - Test your token works: `curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user`

4. **Permission denied**
   - Ensure your GitHub token has access to the target repositories
   - Check if the repository exists and you have the required permissions

### Debug Mode
For verbose logging, you can modify the `gitmcp.py` file to add debug output or run with Python's verbose flag:
```bash
python -v gitmcp.py
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
